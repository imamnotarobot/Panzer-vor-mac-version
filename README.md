Are you one of the few people who have seen NoxCaos' game 'Panzer Vor' (https://www.indiedb.com/games/panzervorgame/downloads/panzer-vor-08)? Are you also the one of few people who own a Mac? well for the 1 other person who meets this quota, do I have a treat for you! I 'ported' it to the Mac using wine. (please note: I do not think this works on M1 Macs, and I have only tested it on my mid-2011 iMac)

it is quite a chonky file, so  in order to store it on github, I did have to split it. If you want to extract it I suggest using Keka (https://www.keka.io/en/)
