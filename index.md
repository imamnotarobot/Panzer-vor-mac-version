## Panzer vor mac version

has this ever happened to you?:
person 1: I want to play NoxCaos' game panzer vor, that I downloaded from here: https://www.indiedb.com/games/panzervorgame, but I have a mac, so I can't.
person 2: well you cant.
--the end--

wait, it hasn't?

well anyway, if you have a mac, and want to give it a try, look no further
